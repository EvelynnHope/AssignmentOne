Lemonade diversifies the insurance landscape by extending into areas like pet, personal and life insurance.
The insurance industry relies upon information in order to measure risk. Tech has an incredible opportunity for synergizing financial data and systems with the insurance process.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The insurance industry has existed for thousands of years, while  digital infrastructures are significantly young with regard to financial technology  pertaining to insurance. Introducing FinTech and InsurTech into the existing insurance structure enables particpation in the value chain; prioritizing the consumer needs and access to specialized and money saving coverages.[6]

Lemonade is unique in that is built from the ground up and departs from the challenge of "legacy baggage". Legacy baggage is a result of outdated infrastructures and workflow patterns which resist changes or modernization.[5] Lemonade updates the insurance industry with both innovation in processes as well as fluidity for evolving with the customer despite legacy modeled insurance systems.

As a major disruptor in the insurance industry based upon the departure from traditional, legacy based insurance models--Lemonade intends to maintain the client's personalization in tandem with profit minded innovations. [7] Expedition of claims payments, increased fraud protections, and maximizing data analytics are major changes to the insurance industry aimed to reflect the consumer's mobile app based use trends.[8]

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Key Performance Idicator (KPI) is a metric used to monitor an insurance company's performance and efficiency.[9] KPI's are utilized to compare companies against one another regarding investment. Top 5 KPI's include 1. Revenue per client; 2. Average Class Attendence; 3. Client Retention Rate; 4. Profit Margin; 5. Average Daily Attendence.[10] True to the personality of the company, Lemonade utilizes Click Through Rate based on homepage performance as a measure for average daily attendence.[9] Client Retention Rate is another area where Lemonade chooses alternative measures by offering a feature called Switching. Switching offers a refund incentive for users to leave a current carrier and buy an new one from Lemonade. Core values like Transparency and Honesty are at the root of the InsurTech's product line, the intention based in a transition from the traditional brick and mortar (aka slow) style insurance experience to the automated, mobile 'Agent'.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
The competitors pool is still growing in the digital insurance industry. The major players playing to different needs in the InsurTech domain, Lemonade leads as the best for home insurance. MetroMile dominates in the low mileage auto insurance area while Insurify maintains a hold on best digital insurer for auto insurance quotes.[11]


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Lemonade could benefit from a scaled approach to specialized insurance coverage much like Root Insurance's auto app. The app tracks driving habits in order to calculate insurance rates. Complex algorithms can distinguish between the client's travel state from driving to biking.[11]

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Following suit with Lemonade's innovative approach to personal insurance, limiters which customize the client's experience will align with the core values of transparency and honesty as vehicles for getting the best value to the policyholder.



* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Data collection maximization for existing and potential policyholders is a root motivator for the concept of Lemonade Insurance.[9] Changing the insurance industry's traditional presence as a profit driven, slow paying, and cumbersome business into a consumer designed and centric service brings insurance into modern times.[7]
